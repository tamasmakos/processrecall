"""Regression guard: the retrieval strategy fork is gone and stays gone.

The agentic (ReAct) retriever was a SECOND full retrieval implementation, live
only under `llm_assisted`. That mode measured worse on the benchmark it exists
for -- 0.750 against llm_free's 0.862, with 3x the abstention rate -- so it was
deleted along with `processrecall/retrieval/query/decompose.py`, its only caller.

The SELECTOR outlived it: a one-member enum, a `strategy` parameter threaded
through `build_retriever`, and a validation expression whose only effect was to
raise on a value nothing could produce. These tests pin the shape that is left
-- one retriever, selected by nothing -- so the fork cannot grow back by
accident.
