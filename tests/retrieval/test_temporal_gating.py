"""``asks_for_a_date`` fires only when the query asks for a date.

The retriever's temporal collector went with the TEMPORAL plane; what survives
is the predicate, which a golden temporal channel over ``SEGMENT.observed_at``
must gate on. Its defect was that the fallback fired on EVERY date-free query. Measured on
conv-30: 78 of 79 date-free queries received temporal votes, while only 56 of
369 chunks carry a MENTIONS_DATE edge. So 15% of the corpus collected a free
extra channel vote on essentially every query, temporal or not — and because
RRF sums across channels, breadth beat relevance: 84.4% of the top-25 pool went
to chunks appearing in 4-5 channels, while 38.7% of the gold evidence appeared
in only 2-3. Gold ranks on the failing questions were 42, 51, 73, 76, 94
against a top_k of 25.
