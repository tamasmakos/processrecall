"""Integration test: DETRetriever returns non-empty results against live ArcadeDB.

Requires ArcadeDB to be reachable. Skips automatically in environments where it
is not (controlled by the ``integration`` pytest marker and infrastructure checks).

Both tests run on a scratch ``mem_test_<uuid>`` database and drop it after:
the shared default database is whatever the developer last ingested, stamped
or not, and a test must neither depend on that nor delete from it.
