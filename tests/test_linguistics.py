"""Modality/polarity/epistemic rules, sentence by sentence (plan §11.8).

This is the one stage whose errors are invisible in aggregate metrics: a wrong
``epistemic`` does not fail an ingest, does not move evidence_recall, and only
shows up as a confidently wrong answer much later. So every rule gets a sentence
with its expected value written out.

The trigger offset is located by searching for the trigger word, which is how
the SRL path supplies it.
