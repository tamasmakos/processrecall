"""The LoCoMo-specific decisions in the LangGraph agent.

Rendering used to live here too and is now
:func:`processrecall.models.hit.render_memories`, covered in
``tests/models/test_hit.py`` — including the one behaviour both arms depend on:
a hit with a ``ts`` renders dated and attributed, a hit without one (the
``--prefix`` arm) passes through carrying its own inline date.

What stays LoCoMo's own is how a dataset message becomes a turn.
