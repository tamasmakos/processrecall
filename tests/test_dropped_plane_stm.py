"""The STM plane is gone: no package, no service factory, no closed `Role`.

A plane is only dropped once nothing can still reach it, so this checks the
deleted package *and* that no module left behind imports it, builds its
service, or types a speaker against the four-value enum. What replaces it is
the neutral pair: a session is a `Source`, a turn is a `Segment`.
