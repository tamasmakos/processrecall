"""FR-016: a section switched off is not asked for and produces nothing.

Scenario 3.3 is the shape all three cases are built to: the relation section off
must leave entities and frame instances standing and produce no relations at all
— and in particular no GLiNER-produced substitute, which on this decoder is
structurally impossible rather than merely unused (contracts/decoder.md §1).

The stub provider answers with all three sections whatever it was asked for, so a
section that comes back empty came back empty because the switch trimmed it, not
because the reply was short. Each case also reads what actually went out: an
ablation whose section is still in the prompt measures nothing.
