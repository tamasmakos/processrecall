"""Guard tests for the linguistic helpers left behind by the SVO removal.

``relations/svo.py`` mined relations; that miner is gone (measured on a live
conv-30 graph it produced 28 of the 43 relation edges and 25 of those 28 were
``<speaker> HAS <common noun>`` — ``Jon HAS back``, ``Jon HAS corner``). Three
helpers in that module were never relation mining and still have callers, so
they moved to ``relations/_lingfeatures.py``:

* ``_resolve``       — speaker resolution for frame-SRL role fillers
* ``noun_supersense``— the WordNet type fallback for relation arguments
* ``parse_speaker``  — the LoCoMo ``"ts | Speaker: text"`` turn-line parser
