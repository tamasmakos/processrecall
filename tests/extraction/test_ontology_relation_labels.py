"""The relation label space is the ontology's, end to end through the real model.

``extract(text, extra_relation_labels=...)`` is handed ``{property label ->
definition}`` for the ontology properties nearest the chunk embedding
(``stm/ingest.py::_label_hints``). Those labels ARE the relation spec — since the
SVO miner was deleted there is no other source — so a relation that comes out
carries the ontology property's own name.

These run the real relex model, because the claim being tested is that relex
answers to a schema.org label at all. A mocked model can only prove the label
reached it.
