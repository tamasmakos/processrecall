"""Repo-shape contract: pins the post-cleanup state issue #203 describes.

The image build never read `uv.lock` — the Dockerfile resolved fresh from
`pyproject.toml`'s ranges via a lock-free `uv pip install`, disagreeing with
what CI and every developer resolve from. Around that defect sat a four-stage
image (`builder`->`models`->`runtime`->`dev`) whose only reason to exist was a
shipped deployment artifact (`docker-compose.prod.yaml`) that no longer
exists now the PyPI wheel is the product. Everything else pinned here is the
same root cause's debris: a runtime-only HEALTHCHECK/HF_HUB_OFFLINE/model-bake
stage, a lock-hash staleness guard for a lock the image never used, an
unpinned SonarQube CLI install and the skip_sonar plumbing threaded through
CI, and pytest.ini/ruff.toml/.devcontainer/Node ignore rules a Python-only
repo does not need.

Read files as TEXT with pathlib + re, not PyYAML: this project declares no
yaml dependency, and YAML 1.1 parses the bare `on:` key as the boolean True,
which makes structural assertions on it worse than a regex over text.
pyproject.toml is parsed with `tomllib` since that one is genuinely TOML.

Tests are grouped by area; each assertion names the file and the property it
pins so a failure is legible without reading this docstring.
