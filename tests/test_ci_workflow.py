"""CI workflow contract: what makes ci.yml callable and its output publishable.

These invariants exist because ci.yml is currently a leaf workflow — its `on:`
block only fires on pull_request/push/workflow_dispatch — so a release/tag
workflow has no way to reuse it and would have to duplicate every check:

  * `workflow_call` is the seam a release workflow needs to invoke `gate` and
    `wheel` without duplicating them.
  * `cancel-in-progress` currently cancels every non-main ref, tag refs
    included — a tag build superseded by another push to the same tag is
    exactly the release artifact that must survive, not be cancelled.
  * `wheel` builds `--wheel` only and never uploads `dist/`: CI proves a
    wheel *can* be built but produces nothing publishable, and the sdist the
    project ships (`[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]`) is never built at all.

Read as text with pathlib + re, not PyYAML: this project does not declare a
yaml dependency, and YAML 1.1 parses the bare `on:` key as the boolean
`True`, which makes structural assertions on it worse than a regex over text.

`.pip-audit-ignore` is exercised here too (test 5) because both scripts/gate.sh
and the `audit` job in this same file extract its entries with the identical
`grep -oE '^(PYSEC|GHSA)[A-Za-z0-9-]+'` — an entry shaped so that regex cannot
see it is a vulnerability silently un-ignored.

  * Every third-party `uses:` reference in ci.yml and release.yml must be
    pinned to a commit hash, not a mutable tag — the same rationale already
    recorded next to `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` in release.yml, extended
    to the rest of both workflows as one convention instead of one exception.
