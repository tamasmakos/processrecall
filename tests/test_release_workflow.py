"""Release workflow contract: what makes a tag push actually publish.

These invariants exist because nothing in the repo publishes the package
today — a release is still a hand-run `uv build` + upload from a laptop.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` was already made `workflow_call`-able (see
test_ci_workflow.py) specifically so a tag-triggered release workflow could
reuse it, but no caller exists yet:

  * The release workflow must fire on `vX.Y.Z` tag pushes only — never on
    pull_request or branch pushes, which would publish on every commit.
  * It must call `ci.yml` by reference (`uses:`) rather than re-implementing
    `uv sync` / `pytest`, otherwise the two checklists drift out of sync.
  * Publishing must depend on that call succeeding (`needs:`), and must not
    build a second time — it consumes the `dist` artifact CI already built
    and uploaded, so what ships is exactly what CI tested.
  * The tag/version check must read the literal out of
    `processrecall/_version.py` as text, never `import processrecall` — importing
    the package to release it is exactly backwards (it may not even be
    installable yet) and the version must never be hand-restated in the
    workflow, or the two will eventually disagree.
  * Publishing must go through PyPI's Trusted Publisher (OIDC), which needs
    `id-token: write` scoped to the publish job only (never at the top-level
    `permissions:` block, which would over-grant it to every job) and a
    SHA-pinned `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` — a mutable tag on a publishing
    action is a supply-chain hole, and a stored `PYPI_API_TOKEN` is exactly
    the long-lived secret Trusted Publisher exists to remove.
  * The release run needs its own concurrency group with cancellation off —
    reusing CI's group, or leaving cancel-in-progress on, risks a superseded
    run cancelling the actual publish.

A second, real defect rides along: docs/versioning.md claims the version is
single-sourced from `processrecall/__init__.py`, while
`[tool.hatch.version] path = "processrecall/_version.py"` is what the build
backend actually reads (`__init__.py` merely re-exports it). Anyone
automating a release from that sentence automates the wrong file.

Read as text with pathlib + re, not PyYAML: this project does not declare a
yaml dependency, and YAML 1.1 parses the bare `on:` key as the boolean
`True`, which makes structural assertions on it worse than a regex over text.
