"""Sense-anchored WordNet expansion replaces first-sense lookup (issue #141).

``skos.lexicalize`` stamps a concept's altLabels with the lemmas of its label's
FIRST WordNet synset, at scheme-BUILD time — before any mention exists to
disambiguate against. ``lexical.evoked`` then fires a one-token concept
whenever any of those synonyms appears in a chunk, in whatever sense the
speaker meant. The fix moves expansion to match time: a present lemma may only
license expansion through a synset chosen by embedding the trigger-starred
mention line against the candidate synsets' definitions, above a similarity
threshold AND a top1-top2 margin, abstaining otherwise. These three tests pin
the seam (``skos.lexicalize`` + ``skos.lexical_index`` + ``labels.entity_labels``
/ ``labels.relation_labels``) without touching any private helper, so the file
compiles and runs both before and after the fix.

    "Allows" is deliberately NOT BFO-typed, so the existing upper-ontology
    blocklist in ``lexicalize`` cannot mask the mechanism under test. Today
    ``lexicalize`` gives "Allows" the altLabel "let" (allow -> permit.v.01 ->
    {permit, allow, let, countenance}), so the property is offered for "Gina
    let her flat to a student" — the LEASING sense of "let", not the permission
    sense. Nobody asserted a permission relation in that sentence; the property
    fires purely because the word appears, in any sense at all. This test must
    fail until expansion is anchored to the mention's actual sense.

    No ``domain``/``range`` is declared, on purpose: ``relation_labels``'
    structural half only offers a property whose declared domain AND range are
    both satisfied by ``entity_types``, so a domain/range pair matching
    ``{"person", "product"}`` would let "Allows" through structurally with zero
    lexical evidence, passing (or failing) regardless of anything this test
    means to pin. Leaving both empty routes "Allows" through the LEXICAL half
    only — exactly the mechanism under test.
