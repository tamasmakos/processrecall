"""A defined class states its genus in ``owl:equivalentClass``, not ``subClassOf``.

CCO writes ~447 classes this way: no ``rdfs:subClassOf`` at all, the parent buried
in ``owl:equivalentClass [ owl:intersectionOf ( <genus> <restriction>... ) ]``.
Reading only ``subClassOf`` leaves every one of them parentless, which truncates
the ancestor walk that relation-offer widening and the BROADER retrieval hop both
stand on. These tests pin the three member kinds apart: a genus is a parent, a
restriction filler is not, and a union member is a CHILD and must never be one.
