"""The bring-your-own-ontology tool: importable without rdflib, honest when it is missing.

``digest`` moved into the package precisely so users can digest their own RDF,
which means a base install (no ``ontology`` extra) must be able to *import* it —
only ``build`` may need rdflib, and it must say which extra to install rather
than raising a bare ImportError at the user.
