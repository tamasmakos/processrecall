"""Identity: which entities are one, on what evidence, and reversibly.

Three things keep this honest. The **mention layer** is the input — an entity is
what its mentions say it is, so its surfaces stay attached to their segments and
its type is a histogram of every label it was read under, never the first one
seen (FR-016, FR-021). The **ladder** is the decision — veto, then strong, then
weak — and it stops at the first rung that answers: a pack veto or disjoint
sibling concepts forbid both merge and candidate (FR-019), an identical
normalised key within a block with agreeing concepts merges (FR-017), and
anything weaker is a scored candidate the recall path commits (FR-018). The
**plan** is the output: every :class:`Link` of a batch is decided before a
single one is applied, so the ``MERGED_INTO`` log exists before the structural
change it records and a merge is replayable — and undoable — from the log alone.
