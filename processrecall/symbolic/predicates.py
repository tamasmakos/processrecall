"""The predicate index — the second symbol kind, resolved from what a decoder said.

An extractor answers with a relation *string*; a fact names a predicate *symbol*
(FR-011). This index is the one place that crossing happens: it holds a pack's
:class:`~processrecall.models.symbols.PredicateRef` vocabulary and answers with the
symbol a surface form names, so nothing downstream ever holds a free string.

Every surface a predicate is reachable by — its label, its canonical rendering
and its id — is normalised the same way, so ``works_at``, ``Works At`` and
``works at`` all reach one symbol.
