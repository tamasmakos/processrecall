"""Project a folder of RDF files onto a property graph with usable node metadata.

The question this answers is not "how do I load RDF" — rdflib does that — but
what a *property graph* should look like once mixed schemes (OWL / RDFS / SKOS)
and mixed releases of the same ontology have been merged into one graph. Four
rules, each of which exists because the naive reading loses something:

1. **A literal object is metadata, keyed by the FULL predicate IRI + lang tag.**
   CURIEs come from the shipped table in :mod:`~processrecall.symbolic.ontology.rdf.prefixes`
   and never from document bindings — those produced ``default1``..``default15``
   on the CCO corpus.
2. **An IRI object is an edge**, keyed by predicate CURIE plus predicate IRI.
3. **A blank node is never a vertex.** OWL restrictions / unions / intersections
   collapse to direct edges ``S -onProperty-> filler``; literals stranded on a
   blank node (reified ``owl:Axiom``, cardinality restrictions) are re-anchored
   on the IRI they describe rather than dropped, keyed by a SKOLEM id
   (:func:`~processrecall.symbolic.ontology.rdf_io.skolem_ids`) because an rdflib
   ``BNode`` id is different on every parse of the same file.
4. **Every literal predicate is kept, but sorted.** :data:`STRUCTURAL` plumbing
   is dropped (it is already modelled as edges or flags), roles are promoted to
   flat fields, and the rest is kept with a human name resolved from the graph's
   own ``rdfs:label`` — which is the only thing that makes ``cco:ont00001760``
   legible.

The load-bearing part is :func:`_expand`. Resolving a class expression to its
leaf IRIs conflates three different relationships, and that conflation is what
stranded 447 defined CCO classes at the top of the taxonomy: intersection
members are the **genus** (the subject is subsumed by them), union members are
**disjuncts** (they are subsumed by the subject — the direction reverses), and a
restriction filler is not subsumption at all. Each edge therefore carries a
``via`` in ``{direct, genus, disjunct, restriction, complement, enumeration,
expression}``, and the taxonomy layer reads it.

Needs the ``ontology`` extra (rdflib, networkx). The tables below are stdlib.
