r"""Parse RDF ontologies into the pre-parsed digest processrecall ships and loads.

This is how you bring your own ontology. processrecall bundles a CCO digest as the
default, but any RDF source becomes usable by digesting it here and pointing
``GRAPHKNOWS_ONTOLOGY`` at the result — the loader reads a digest identically
whichever ontology produced it. It lives in the package rather than in the repo's
``scripts/`` for exactly that reason: it is a user-facing tool, not a build step
of ours. Needs the ``ontology`` extra (rdflib); nothing else here does.

Why a digest rather than the raw ``.ttl``:

* **No rdflib at runtime.** ``rdflib`` is in the ``ontology`` extra, but the
  ontology layer is always on, including in the default ``llm_free`` mode that a
  bare ``pip install processrecall`` gives you. Reading a plain JSON digest keeps
  the base install free of an RDF stack it would otherwise need on every ingest,
  and makes both modes load the ontology through one identical code path.
* **Startup cost.** Parsing 3 MB of Turtle across 12 modules costs seconds;
  reading the digest costs milliseconds.

The bundled ontology is the Common Core Ontologies: the 11 CCO modules, the
Familial Relations extension, and **BFO**, which is not optional. Four things
about CCO decide how this parses:

* **Opaque IRIs.** CCO names every term ``ont00001774``, so a URI's local name
  is not a label. ``domain``/``range``/``parents`` are therefore resolved
  through a URI->label map built across ALL input files before any term is
  emitted — a per-file parse would leave every cross-module reference as an
  ont-number, which is unreadable to an embedder and useless to the relation
  conformance check.
* **CCO types its relations against BFO.** ``rdfs:domain obo:BFO_0000015``
  (process), ``obo:BFO_0000004`` (independent continuant). BFO is an *import*
  — CCO's own ``catalog-v001.xml`` resolves it to ``../cco-imports/bfo-core.ttl``
  — so a map built from the CCO modules alone resolves every one of those
  references to nothing and DROPS the constraint. Measured: the CCO modules plus
  the familial extension alone digest to 1401 classes and 224 object properties,
  of which only 112 declare BOTH a domain and a range — and since property
  selection is gated on both, the other half of the relation vocabulary is
  silently unofferable. Parsing BFO alongside gives 1437 classes and 264
  properties, every one of them offerable. (Those two numbers are why a stale
  "1401 classes, 224 properties" reads plausible: it is not an old bundle, it is
  a parse with BFO missing.) BFO's own classes are emitted too: they are what
  the ``parents`` chain terminates in, and without them subsumption stops at the
  CCO boundary instead of reaching ``material entity`` /
  ``independent continuant``.
* **Domain and range hide inside class expressions.** A range is frequently an
  anonymous ``owl:unionOf`` / ``owl:intersectionOf`` node rather than a named
  class. Those are unwrapped to the set of named classes they mention; an
  ``owl:complementOf`` ("not a spatial region") carries no positive label and is
  skipped rather than inverted.
* **Definitions live in ``skos:definition``.** ``rdfs:comment`` in CCO is an
  editorial note ("This class was added at the request of..."), so it is only a
  fallback. ``skos:scopeNote`` carries usage guidance written in the same
  register as conversational prose and is appended to the definition: it is
  extra retrieval surface for the same term, and it is what makes a class
  reachable from text that never says its label.

Only OBJECT properties are kept. A ``owl:DatatypeProperty`` describes a literal
attribute, not a link between two entities, so it can never be an
ENTITY->ENTITY relation and would only dilute the relation label space handed to
the extractor.

Usage — your own ontology::

    python -m processrecall.symbolic.ontology.digest --source my-ontology.ttl --out my.json
    export GRAPHKNOWS_ONTOLOGY=my.json

Usage — regenerating the bundled CCO digest::

    python -m processrecall.symbolic.ontology.digest \\
        --source processrecall/symbolic/ontology/assets/cco-modules \\
        --source processrecall/symbolic/ontology/assets/cco-extensions/FamilialRelationsOntology.ttl \\
        --source processrecall/symbolic/ontology/assets/cco-imports/bfo-core.ttl \\
        --out processrecall/symbolic/ontology/assets/cco/cco.json

Those three sources are also :data:`BUNDLED_SOURCES`, which is what the drift
check rebuilds from — so this recipe cannot quietly disagree with the asset.

# FamilialRelationsOntology declares no domain or range on any of its 87

# vocabulary this bundle is for. Person->Person is true of the module by
# construction (it is the ontology of relations between family members), so
# asserting it here restores the module without weakening the gate.
#
# No other module needs an entry. Once the ``owl:unionOf`` blank nodes are
# unwrapped (see :meth:`_Reader.named`), every other property in the bundle
# declares or inherits both endpoints — this fallback fires for exactly the 87
