"""Mechanics shared by the retrieval channels.

Every channel that joins a symbolic tag back to segments does the same two
things: drop the tags so common they carry no signal, then collapse the
surviving rows into one RRF-ranked score per segment.

Lives under ``channels/`` rather than ``symbolic/``: saturation is measured in
SEGMENT coverage and RRF is a fusion concept, so both are retrieval concerns.
The layer contract puts ``channels`` above ``symbolic``, and pushing a retrieval
idea down into the knowledge layer would invert it.
