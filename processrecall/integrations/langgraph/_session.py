"""A session-bound view over :class:`~processrecall.memory.Memory` for LangGraph.

The rest of this adapter is framework-agnostic: ``recall`` and
``remember`` in ``_hooks.py`` are plain ``state -> partial-state``
callables, bound to a memory and a session via ``functools.partial``. That is
flexible but verbose for the common case of "one session, one memory, three
node callables". ``GraphKnowsMemory`` is that common case wrapped up — it
owns (or borrows) a ``Memory`` and hands out bound node methods, so wiring a
graph is three ``add_node`` calls instead of three ``partial(...)`` calls.

It depends on nothing from langgraph — its nodes are plain dict-in/dict-out
callables — so importing this module is free, exactly like the hooks module
it wraps.
