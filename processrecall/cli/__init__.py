"""Command-line entry points.

Composition roots: a CLI wires the facade (:mod:`processrecall.memory`) to argv and
stdout, so it sits *above* every capability package. That is why entry points
live here rather than as a ``__main__`` inside a capability package — a
``__main__`` inside a low layer makes that layer depend on the facade above it,
which the architecture contract forbids and which ``lint-imports`` rejects.
