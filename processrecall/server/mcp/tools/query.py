    """Retrieve the most relevant memories for a query.

    A thin adapter over :meth:`processrecall.Memory.recall_memory` — the same call
    an in-process caller makes, so this transport cannot drift from it. Driving
    the retriever directly here is what left the MCP hit shape without a speaker
    or a timestamp, capped ``top_k`` where the facade had deliberately removed
    its ceiling, and gave ``scope="stm"`` a different meaning over MCP than in
    process.

    Args:
        query: Natural-language question or search phrase.
        session_id: Session to scope the search to.
        top_k: Maximum hits to return, up to 100 (FR-030); a higher value is
            rejected rather than clamped.
        scope: Which memory tier to search — ``"stm"`` (this session's buffered,
            unflushed turns), ``"ltm"`` (the graph), or ``"both"`` (default).

    Returns:
        Dict with a ``hits`` list — each hit the wire form of
        :class:`~processrecall.models.hit.Hit` (``text``, ``speaker``, ``ts``,
        ``score``, ``sources``, ``session_id``, ``chunk_id``, ``doc_id``,
        ``entities``, ``metadata``) — plus ``total``, ``query``, ``scope`` and
        the structured ``facts`` sheet.
