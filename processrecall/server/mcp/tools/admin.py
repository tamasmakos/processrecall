"""MCP admin tools.

The two destructive tools are defined unconditionally — they stay importable,
mockable and testable — but they are only *registered* on the app when
``GRAPHKNOWS_ENABLE_ADMIN_TOOLS`` is set. FastMCP builds ``list_tools`` from the
decorator, so a guard inside the body would still advertise a tool it then
refuses to run.
