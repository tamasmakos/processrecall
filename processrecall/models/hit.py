"""One recalled memory, and the one way a ranked list of them renders.

Every adapter over :meth:`processrecall.Memory.recall_memory` — the LangGraph
nodes, the langgraph store, the MCP tool, an evaluation harness — needs the
same three things from a hit: its text, who said it, and when. Before this
module each of them re-derived that projection from an untyped ``dict``, and
they disagreed: the MCP shape carried no ``speaker`` and no ``ts`` at all, so
every consumer downstream of it recovered the date by regex-scraping the
passage text and the attribution not at all.

:class:`Hit` is that shape, once. :func:`render_memories` is the other half —
turning ranked hits into the dated, attributed, chronological block an answerer
reads. Rendering lives here rather than in each caller because the decisions in
it are not presentation taste; they are measured:

- **Selection runs in relevance order, display in chronological order.** Sorting
  first and truncating the joined string deletes the newest memories
  mid-sentence, so a May-September conversation answers "not mentioned" for
  September facts that were retrieved correctly.
- **Whole memories are dropped, never truncated**, and a skipped memory does not
  stop the scan — a shorter, lower-ranked one may still fit.
- **Undated memories keep their retrieval order** and follow the timeline.
