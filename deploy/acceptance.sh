# The offline acceptance run (SC-001…SC-003): ingest a document into the running
# stack and search for a phrase from it. An empty result is a FAILURE here, never
# an answer — that is the whole point of running it.
#
#   EGRESS_BLOCKED_BY=firewall sh deploy/acceptance.sh
#
# HOW EGRESS IS ACTUALLY BLOCKED. This script cannot check it: a truly air-gapped
# host and a networked laptop produce byte-identical output below. So the method
# is named by the operator, echoed into the run log, and a run that names none is
# marked as what it is. Pick one before running:
#
#   internal: true   a `networks:` block in a compose override marking the stack's
#                    network internal — the containers get no route off the host,
#                    and only the app↔arcadedb link survives.
#   --network none   `docker run --network none` on a single container. Fine for
#                    the boot check, NOT for this run: the app must still reach
#                    arcadedb, which `none` also cuts.
#   firewall         host rules (iptables/nftables/pf) dropping outbound traffic
#                    from the container subnet, with the database left reachable.
#
# SC-002 and SC-003 are the preconditions of getting this far rather than steps of
# their own: the app only started because scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh found the
# baked models, and compose only started it because arcadedb passed its
# healthcheck. If either failed, the `exec` below fails loudly naming the service.
